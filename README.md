# Knitted Knockers
This project dives into the world of knitted breast prostheses on the knitting platform [Ravelry.com](https://www.ravelry.com/). It explores how breast cancer survivors knit new breasts for themselves (and others) after they have undergone mastectomy surgeries.

### Notebooks
- `data_collection`: This notebook scrapes the knitting recipes in the 'medical knitting' subcategory on Ravelry.com and gathers information on the pattern and their popularity among the ravelry community. 
- `data_analysis`: This notebook analyses the data gathered in `data_collection` alongside data from the CDC and manually collected data on the recommended yarn for the knitted knockers and the price of the yarn.
- `data_visualization`: This notebook uses the R package ggplot to create the basic visualization of the data. The visualizations were later imported to illustrator and refined.
