# Knitted Knockers
This project dives into the world of knitted breast prostheses on the knitting platform [Ravelry.com](https://www.ravelry.com/). It explores how breast cancer survivors knit new breasts for themselves (and others) after they have undergone mastectomy surgeries. 
The result is the article [Medical Knitting: How Breast Cancer Survivors Handle Mastectomies One Knitted Knocker at a Time](https://laurabejder.com/knitting/).

### Notebooks
- `data_collection`: This notebook scrapes the knitting recipes in the 'medical knitting' subcategory on Ravelry.com and gathers information on the pattern and their popularity among the ravelry community. 
- `data_analysis`: This notebook analyses the data gathered in `data_collection` alongside data from the CDC and manually collected data on the recommended yarn for the knitted knockers (the often used name for knitted breast prostheses) and the price of the yarn.
- `data_visualization`: This notebook uses the R package ggplot to create the basic visualization of the data. The visualizations were later imported to illustrator and refined.
